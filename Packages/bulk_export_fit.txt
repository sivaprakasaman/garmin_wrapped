/*
Here's javascript that can be run in any modern browser fairly simply in javascript. Might be easier to set up than Python.
 
You'll want to pre-set a download location in your browser settings to some folder, name it TCX or something, and tell your browser to auto-download there, or else you'll get a ton of popup save dialogs.
 
First Navigate to the last (most recent) activity you have in Garmin Connect (as in https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/5555555555 ), then hit F12 (should work in chrome/IE) to open dev tools to get to the Javascript Console. Then paste the below code and hit enter to run it. Can change ttl from 100 to whatever # of activities you want to download.
If you want a different format, change the "tcx" part of the URL to the appropriate format acronym if garmin supports it.
If your connection is too slow to do a full download in less than 3 seconds every time, change the downloadTimeoutLength from 3 * 1000 to whatever number you want (it's 3*1000 because that's 3000 milliseconds = 3 seconds).
 
[CODE]*/
var a = window.location.pathname.split("/");
var id = a[a.length-1];
var tcxUrl = "https://connect.garmin.com/modern/proxy/download-service/export/tcx/activity/";
var cnt = 1, ttl = 1323; /*Change ttl from 100 to whatever # of activities you want to download*/
var downloadTimeoutLength = 3 * 1000;
var downloadUrl = tcxUrl + id;
window.location.href = downloadUrl;
 
setTimeout(
   (getMore = function(){
    jQuery.getJSON("https://connect.garmin.com/modern/proxy/activity-service/activity/"+id+"/relative?_="+Math.random()
        ,function(d){
            id = d.previousActivityId;
            downloadUrl = tcxUrl + id;
            window.location.href = downloadUrl;
            if(++cnt<ttl){
                setTimeout(getMore,downloadTimeoutLength );
            }
        }
    );
   })
   ,downloadTimeoutLength 
);
